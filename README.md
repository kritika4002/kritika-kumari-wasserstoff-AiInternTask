#  Object Segmentation and Identification

This project provides a comprehensive solution for object segmentation and identification using deep learning techniques, specifically leveraging the Pascal VOC dataset. The model processes images to segment distinct objects, identify them, and label them accordingly. An intuitive Streamlit GUI allows users to upload images, perform segmentation, save results with unique identifiers, and maintain a structured database for efficient object identification.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:

   git clone https://github.com/pratham-asthana/object-segmentation-and-identification.git
   cd object-segmentation-and-identification
   
2.** Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

pip install -r requirements.txt
**Usage**
1. Run the Streamlit application:
streamlit run app.py

2. **Upload an image**: Use the provided GUI to upload an image for object segmentation and identification.

3. **View Results**: The application displays segmented objects, assigns unique IDs to each, and shows their corresponding labels.

## **Features**
📍 **Object Segmentation:** Utilizes deep learning models trained on the Pascal VOC dataset to accurately segment objects in uploaded images.
📍 **Object Identification:** Identifies and labels segmented objects based on Pascal VOC categories.
📍 **User-Friendly Streamlit GUI**: An intuitive interface for seamless interaction with the model.
📍 **Database Management:** Maintains a database of segmented objects for future retrieval and identification.
📍 **Instant Feedback:** Real-time processing and display of results.
